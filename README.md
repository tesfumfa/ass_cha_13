<h1>Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) Challenge: E-commerce Back End</>
  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>My challenge this week was to build the back end for an e-commerce site. I was given a working Express.js API and instructed to configure it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. Testing was completed in locally in the browser . The application will not be deployed, so a video walkthrough is provided below.</p>
<h2>User Story</h2>
<p> AS A manager at an internet retail company<br/>
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies<br>
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies</p>
<h2>Acceptance Criteria</h2>
<p> GIVEN a functional Express.js API<br/>
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file<br/>
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize<br/>
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands<br/>
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data<br/>
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application<br/>
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database<br/>
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags<br/>
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON<br/>
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core<br/>
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database</p>
<h2>Mock-Up</h2>
<p>The following animations show examples of the application's API routes<br/>
  being tested in server http://localhost:3001 in the browser </p>
